                <p>My name is Beshoy Rezek and I was boring in Giza, Egypt
                I moved to US in 2009 with my fmaily we decided to move
                Kansas City, MO. When I moved to Kansas City I was in a bit
                culture shock everything was so different. I went to Raytown
                South High School and I had to make new friends at school and 
                at church.
                </p>

                <br>

                <p>I gruted in 2012 from high school and went to 
                MCC-Longview (Metropolition Community College) in Lee's Summit, MO
                for two semesters then I transferd to Southwest Bapatis Unvierstity
                in Blovir, Mo to pursue a degree in Biblcail studies and Psychology. 
                But I didn't like it there very much I hate the fact that it was
                in the middle of nowhere and there is nothing to do most days.
                So after a semester I decided to move back to Kansas City and 
                I took a break from school to pay off some of my loans. I got a job 
                at Sheraton Hotel in Overland Park, KS. A few years later I decided to
                go back to school for Computer Seince and after a few class I relized 
                I found about KU full-stack bootcamp and I enrolled in it and I have been enjoyin it.

                    beautful place a person can in.
