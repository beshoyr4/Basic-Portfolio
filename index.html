        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My nane is Beshoy Rezek and I was boring in Giza, Egypt
           I moved to US in 2009 with my fmaily we decided to move
           Kansas City, MO. When I moved to Kansas City I was in a bit
           culture shock everything was so different. I went to Raytown
           South High School and I had to make new friends at school and 
           at church. I gruted in 2012 from high school and went to 
           MCC-Longview (Metropolition Community College) in Lee's Summit, MO
           for two semesters then I transferd to Southwest Bapatis Unvierstity
           in Blovir, Mo to pursue a degree in Biblcail studies and Psychology. 
           But I didn't like it there very much I hate the fact that it was
           in the middle of nowhere and there is nothing to do most days.
           So after a semester I decided to move back to Kansas City and 
           I took a break from school to pay off some of my loans. I got a job 
           at Sheraton Hotel in Overland Park, KS
