        <p>My nane is Beshoy Rezek and I was boring in Giza, Egypt<br>
           I moved to US in 2009 with my fmaily we decided to move<br>
           Kansas City, MO. When I moved to Kansas City I was in a bit<br>
           culture shock everything was so different. I went to Raytown<br>
           South High School and I had to make new friends at school and <br>
           at church. I gruted in 2012 from high school and went to <br>
           MCC-Longview (Metropolition Community College) in Lee's Summit, MO<br>
           for two semesters then I transferd to Southwest Bapatis Unvierstity<br>
           in Blovir, Mo to pursue a degree in Biblcail studies and Psychology. <br>
           But I didn't like it there very much I hate the fact that it was<br>
           in the middle of nowhere and there is nothing to do most days.<br>
           So after a semester I decided to move back to Kansas City and <br>
           I took a break from school to pay off some of my loans. I got a job <br>
           at Sheraton Hotel in Overland Park, KS. A few years later I decided to<br>
           go back to school for Computer Seince and after a few class I relized <br>
           I found about KU full-stack bootcamp and I enrolled in it and I have been enjoyin it.
